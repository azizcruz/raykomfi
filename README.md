I launched my website idea in 2020 but decided to shut it down in 2021. The concept, inspired by the Arabic phrase "raykom fi" (what's your opinion), aimed to provide a unique platform for product reviews. Users could ask for feedback on desired products in feeds, and responses were voted on, akin to the Stack Overflow model.

To enhance visibility, I focused on optimizing SEO for first-page results. Each approved post was automatically shared on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, featuring a customized background image for the latter. The website was built using Django and jQuery with AJAX for dynamic interactions.

Notably, I put significant effort into obtaining approval from AdSense to monetize the platform.
